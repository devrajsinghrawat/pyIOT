venv are not getting create properly
why i can see both base and new created env
how to should create venv properly (should it be created in the folder where my project directory exist or should it be
created in a system default localion for every project if yes how to do that)

- why flask debug option are coming in debug config
- why Interpreter selection option is not showing the locally created env



- We should create the venv in the local project with the command python -m venv <env_name>
- We need to activate the venv using source /<env_name>/bin/activate
- Select the compiler option to the local created env
- you can check pip list for installed packages

-- VS Code Debug config
